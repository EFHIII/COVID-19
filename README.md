A pre-rendered video is included in this REPO.

Since there are over 150,000 the FPS is hard-coded to 5 FPS, but you can view this in your browser here: http://efhiii.github.io/COVID-19

The Animation spreads out data for a single day evenly (randomly) throughout that day's time period within the region it occurred in. I don't have the actual location of every single case, just the countries' confirmed case numbers as compiled by Johns Hopkins University.
